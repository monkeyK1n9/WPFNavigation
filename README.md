## Introduction

This is a showcase of navigation in a WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) project.
The app has two screens, Home and Settings and the user can switch between them.

## Getting started

Clone, download or fork the repo.
Restore the packages
```console
dotnet restore
```

Or, if you have Visual Studio or C# dev kit in VSCode, this should run automatically
when you open the app.

You are good to go. Enjoy.
